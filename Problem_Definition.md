## Problem Definition

In the wake of frequent natural disasters such as floods, earthquakes, and fires, there is an urgent need for an intelligent disaster management system. The primary goal of this project is to design a **Smart Disaster Response and Evacuation System** that can ensure efficient rescue operations, optimal evacuation routes, real-time decision-making, and resource allocation during emergencies. By combining data-driven algorithms and automation, this system aims to minimize casualties, reduce response times, and optimize resource utilization.

This system will address the following **12 sub-problems**, along with the **algorithms applied** to solve them:

### Sub-Problems and Algorithms

1. **Evacuation Request Scheduling**  
   - **Objective**: Handle evacuation requests based on the severity of the threat in each zone.  
   - **Algorithm**: **Priority Queue** (to process evacuation requests based on urgency).

2. **Disaster Impact Mapping**  
   - **Objective**: Map affected zones and track the severity of disasters in real-time.  
   - **Algorithm**: **Hashing** (to store and retrieve zone-specific disaster impact data).

3. **Optimal Evacuation Routing**  
   - **Objective**: Find the safest and fastest evacuation routes to shelters.  
   - **Algorithm**: **Dijkstra's Algorithm** (to calculate the shortest and safest paths to shelters).

4. **Dynamic Resource Allocation**  
   - **Objective**: Efficiently allocate resources such as medical supplies and food to disaster-hit zones.  
   - **Algorithm**: **Bellman-Ford Algorithm** (to calculate shortest paths while considering dynamic changes in resource demands).

5. **Shelter-to-Zone Connectivity Analysis**  
   - **Objective**: Assess connectivity between shelters and disaster zones to optimize resource distribution.  
   - **Algorithm**: **Floyd-Warshall Algorithm** (to determine all-pairs shortest paths between zones and shelters).

6. **Evacuation Zone Network Design**  
   - **Objective**: Design a cost-effective network of evacuation zones and shelters.  
   - **Algorithm**: **Prim's Algorithm** (to construct a Minimum Spanning Tree for efficient evacuation zone connections).

7. **High-Risk Zone Prioritization**  
   - **Objective**: Rank disaster-affected zones based on risk levels for rescue operation prioritization.  
   - **Algorithm**: **Heap Sort** (to order zones by severity of disaster impact).

8. **Task Scheduling for Rescue Operations**  
   - **Objective**: Organize and prioritize rescue tasks based on urgency and deadlines.  
   - **Algorithm**: **Merge Sort** (to sort rescue tasks based on priority).

9. **Flood Path Prediction**  
   - **Objective**: Simulate and predict the spread of floods in low-lying areas for preemptive evacuation.  
   - **Algorithm**: **Breadth-First Search (BFS)** (to simulate water flow in the disaster network).

10. **Critical Infrastructure Identification**  
    - **Objective**: Identify infrastructure components (e.g., dams, bridges) whose failure could worsen the disasterâ€™s impact.  
    - **Algorithm**: **Depth-First Search (DFS)** (to locate critical components of the infrastructure).

11. **Resource Distribution Cost Minimization**  
    - **Objective**: Minimize costs associated with distributing resources across disaster-hit zones.  
    - **Algorithm**: **Kruskal's Algorithm** (to design an efficient resource distribution network).

12. **Dynamic Evacuation Path Updates**  
    - **Objective**: Update evacuation paths dynamically to account for blocked roads or emerging hazards.  
    - **Algorithm**: **Linked Lists** (to efficiently manage changes in evacuation routes in real time).
