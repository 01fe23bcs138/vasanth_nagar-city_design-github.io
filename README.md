### Introduction

The **Design and Analysis of Algorithms** course explores how algorithms are designed to solve real-world problems efficiently. It covers key topics like recursion, iteration, backtracking, and dynamic programming, and how to apply data structures such as trees, graphs, and heaps to solve complex problems in various domains.

This course helps connect algorithm theory with practical applications, from optimizing routes in transportation systems to managing large datasets in business.

### Course Project Introduction

The project focuses on identifying **business cases in faulty city designs** that require engineering solutions. The problem space was chosen based on inefficiencies in urban planning, and findings from the white paper highlighted issues in traffic, waste management, and infrastructure. Each team member works on specific business cases, proposing algorithmic solutions to address these challenges.



### **Vasanth Nagar: A Smart City Vision**  

**Overview:**  
Vasanth Nagar (1500 sq km) will be a sustainable, tech-driven city built on an empty land, focused on smart infrastructure, green energy, and inclusive growth.  

**Zoning:**  
- **Residential (500 sq km):** Affordable housing and mid-range communities.  
- **Commercial (200 sq km):** Offices, retail spaces, and tech parks.  
- **Industrial (100 sq km):** Clean industries and manufacturing.  
- **Recreation & Green Spaces (400 sq km):** Parks, lakes, nature reserves.  
- **Infrastructure (300 sq km):** Roads, utilities, transport hubs.  

**Initial Focus (5-Year Plan):**  
1. **Basic Infrastructure:** Roads, metro, water systems, and power grids.  
2. **Housing:** Affordable and eco-friendly residences.  
3. **Smart Utilities:** Solar power, IoT-based water and waste management.  
4. **Connectivity:** Public transport with EV buses and cycling lanes.  

**Budget:**  
- **Estimated Cost:** $40 billion (initial phase).  
- **Funding:** Public-private partnerships, international loans, and government grants.  

**Geography:**  
- Create three artificial lakes (totaling 30 sq km) for water needs and recreation.  
- Preserve natural terrain for tourism and greenery, dedicating 25% to parks and forests.  

**Sustainability:**  
- Solar farms and rainwater harvesting to reduce energy and water costs.  
- Recycling and waste-to-energy plants to manage waste.  

**Goal:**  
To establish a functional, sustainable, and livable city within 5 years, with room for growth into a fully developed smart city over time.  



This is the plan for the city, however there are certain problems which could be solved in an engineered fashion which will help our city grow for the better!

Our team has identified such crucial issued with the idea of adressing these problems and make our city a smarter version of itself.

### Course Learning Reflections

#### Problems in Nature
Problems like **iteration**, **recursion**, and **backtracking** often arise in nature. These techniques are applied depending on the problemâ€™s structure, such as recursive breakdowns for complex issues or backtracking for trial-and-error solutions.

#### Space and Time Efficiency
Understanding **space** and **time efficiency** is crucial for algorithm design. Optimizing both helps in reducing computational costs and memory usage, leading to faster and more scalable solutions.

#### Design Principles
Design principles like **divide and conquer**, **dynamic programming**, and **greedy algorithms** help in creating efficient, optimal solutions for various problems.

#### Tree Data Structures
**Binary search trees (BST)**, **AVL trees**, **heaps**, and **tries** are hierarchical data structures that provide fast data access and are essential for solving problems like searching, sorting, and managing large datasets.

#### Array Query Algorithms
Array query algorithms allow efficient searching, sorting, and data retrieval, applied in systems like databases and search engines.

#### Tree vs. Graph Traversals
**Trees** are traversed using **preorder**, **inorder**, and **postorder** methods, while **graphs** use **DFS** and **BFS** for efficient exploration. These techniques have diverse applications, such as network routing and resource allocation.

#### Sorting and Searching Algorithms
Algorithms like **quick sort**, **merge sort**, and **binary search** are fundamental for organizing and retrieving data. Each algorithm is selected based on the problem's constraints, such as size and performance requirements.

#### Graph Algorithms
Graph algorithms like **shortest path** and **spanning trees** are critical for applications in logistics, communication, and network design.

#### Algorithm Design Techniques
Techniques such as **greedy algorithms**, **divide and conquer**, and **dynamic programming** help solve problems efficiently. Knowing when to use each method is key to optimal problem-solving.

This portfolio demonstrates how the theory and application of algorithms can help solve complex, real-world problems, particularly in urban planning and city design.
